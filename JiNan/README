This is the code of PCLGCN in JiNan dataset!

This is a document for this code++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=>

***First, the structure of the code:

util.py: The reading of data and other functions except of Model

utils.py: all base blocks and functions of neural network models in our paper

model.py: construct model based on utils.py

engine.py: the program of training model in our paper

train.py: main document of this code

***How to run these files?

In jupyter ,you should write:

Firstly, you should run generate_data.py and genenrate_adjacent.py to generate all data and adjacent matrix of JiNan datasets! 

secondly,

run train.py --force True --model (you can select from MMSTGCN, MMOGCRNN, MMASTGCN_Recent, and MMgwnet) --poi data/XiAn_City/POI_data_(100 to 900, you selcet).csv

or 

python train.py --force True --model (you can select from MMSTGCN, MMOGCRNN, MMASTGCN_Recent, and MMgwnet) --poi data/XiAn_City/POI_data_(100 to 900, you selcet).csv
